# mazes-with-dijkstra-and-A-star
This project contains path finding in a maze using Dijkstra and A* algorithm.

Maze:
1)The mazes are constructed using the pyamaze module in python.
2)Then one single maze is solved using A* algorithm , first , then the Dijkstra algorithm is used.

A*:
1)A* algorithm is heuristic search algorithm as it uses the heuristic function h(n).
2)A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function thatÂ ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow.
3)It searches for shorter paths first rather than the longer paths.
4)It uses an evaluation to guide the selection of node.
			F(n) = g(n) + h(n)
5)In this formula, g (n) represents the weight of the path from the starting point to node n and h (n) is the heuristic weight while f (n) is estimated cost of path from node n to target node.   

Dijkstra:
1)Dijkstra algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. 
2)Single-source means that only one source is given, and we have to find the shortest path from the source to all the nodes.
3)It is a type of greedy algorithm (which means it picks the best immediate output, but does not consider the big picture).
4)It only works on weighted graph with positive weights.
